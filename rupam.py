And the goal of this company is to actually democratize the power of data analytics and artificial intelligence and take it to the mass, helping the SMEs, helping the small businesses, helping businesses from various domains, be it retail or entertainment or leisure or, let's say, finance or healthcare. So, Ways Ahead wants to become the global leader in data analytics and data storytelling. So, that's the two forte. Definitely, we want to also endeavor into the next generation of tech, which is Web 3.0. So, talking about metaverse, talking about your assetization and tokenization of your assets and talking about 360, virtual reality, augmented reality. So, we want to delve into that segment at some later stage. But primarily, if you ask me what is Ways Ahead Global, it is a data analytics company. It's a global data analytics company. And also, it ventures into... The AI projects, primarily. The aim is to actually help the... And take things to the mass. That's what Ways Ahead is all about."},
                    {"role": "user", "content": "Why Data Analytics?"},
                    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, why data analytics? I say why not data analytics because I'll just give you an example, I mean data, if you talk from the different connected devices, so data has actually gone manifold. I mean the average number of users, I mean you can Google and then take that statistics and put it over here. So, the average equipments or devices that were there per household, maybe 5 -10 years back that has gone exponentially up, I mean maybe 5 -10 times actually, so which means that the data, I mean the amount of data that is getting generated today has gone manifold.So, you today you have data from IoT devices, you have data from your computers, you have data from your operations, you have data from your apps or even when you drive a car, you generate data, even when you switch on your gadgets at home, you're generating data, even your smartphone is listening all the time, that's also data. So data, I mean if you just see, I mean I say that okay data is just like your air which is around you, you are able to breathe, you are able to survive but you can't see, you can't feel that, you cannot touch air, right?The same thing but you know the power of air, you know the power of the environmental, I would say the oxygen that is there all around you, otherwise how will you survive? So, the same thing goes for data as well, so the only thing is, I mean just imagine a place where we have scarcity of oxygen, you will struggle, you will actually choke and I mean if that place increases day by day and the oxygen level decreases day by day. So you will feel the problems over there right. So that is where data analytics comes into picture. So you can say that data analytics if you take it from a very generic perspective, you can say that it converts carbon dioxide into oxygen if you take it from a layman's perspective.So that is what data analytics does. It takes the data, it takes the scattered data all around that you have that you are generating, convert that into oxygen so that you can breathe, you can survive, you can live your life happily."},
                    {"role": "user", "content": "Why should you choose WaysAhead Global?"},
                    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, why you should choose WaysAhead Global? So WaysAhead Global has actually delved inside the that purview of data and understood the pain points of businesses that okay, that the businesses generate or may have around data and systems. That's what I mean and primarily what happens is why somebody should come to WaysAhead because of the two important things because the fast turnaround and the innovation that we put. I mean every product, so we have got, I think we have delivered more than 100 plus projects into only into data and analytics as well as MVP sector I'm talking about. So there are many other projects and I mean, I think we have got a record of delivering and executing actually 50 plus projects in 25 months which means that we are delivering one project and onboarding one project every two weeks.So that's what the speed is and for this year, I mean 2024, we have a target to reach the IP tomb which is let's say onboarding one project per week and delivering one project per week. That's what the input and output I want to just stabilize and then so which means that the projects are, I mean actually you can give, you can call it as Sprint, so you can call it as projects, you can call it as prototypes, you can call it as MVPs. So whatever it is, we clearly demonstrate the moment the client interacts with us, the first thing that we demonstrate is 30, 60, 90 days plan and then if the client is more eager and let's say inquisitive about. So, we give a 180 days plan also beyond 180 days we usually do not give a plan. We might have a roadmap which is for 2 years. So, please understand why ways ahead doable.So, the first part is whenever we take a project we give very clear demarcation that what are the deliverables that we are going to give, what will be the timeline, what kind of technology stack we will be using. So, there is complete transparency and how much time it is going to take, what will be the architecture, the high level design and if you talk about the business architecture. So, we follow this bat D architecture what we call it as B stands for business architecture, A stands for your application architecture and T stands for technology architecture and down there you have D which is the data architecture.So, these are the 4 things that comes up and ways ahead is building up a very strong presence in terms of bots, a very strong presence in terms of customized APIs and custom APIs and the stack full stack APIs actually and under your Mac architecture primarily.So we will talk about the microservices and the API first and cloud native and headless that is what Mac stands for. And we tend to take all these projects under in a roadmap which will definitely cater to the Mac architecture.So that is the USP. I would say that we help the companies to actually go to the API model which is a sustainable and scalable model as well rather than just building up a WordPress I mean platform and then just give a landing page and then you do not know how to actually integrate it.The major task that the major hindrances that we have found in all the projects that have come to us or that have been re -ordered to us was integration part. So we take up the integrations very seriously.We know how and what needs to be integrated with the client products or projects and how it could be scalable and I mean starting from the SMS or email gateways to payment gateways to Google gateways to navigator gateways to maps gateways to analytics gateways.So all these IoT gateways so all these are just like a few of the examples that I am giving but that is what Wazehead stands for actually. So it will be giving you a perspective. It will be giving you a pathway to go ways ahead. So that is what and we say that okay. We are ways ahead because of you. That is what we believe primarily. So the small businesses, the mid -sized businesses, the enterprises, the new startups, the local entrepreneurs, we stand by them and that is what ways ahead global is all about to make to bring happiness to these young and very energetic and innovative entrepreneurs and founders."},
